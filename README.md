# Real-time-Object-detection-with-TensorFlow

In this project, the Tensorflow object detetion API is used. A few changes are made to the python code so as to enable object detection if live input stream is given through the webcam.

The model used for this is an accurate, yet slow one - 'faster_rcnn_resnet101_coco_2018_01_28'

Steps:
1. Install Tensorflow
2. Install necessary dependencies
3. Download the necessary object detection model
4. Make a few changes to the code to enable reading live input via webcam
