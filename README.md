# Real-time-Object-detection-with-TensorFlow

In this project, the Tensorflow object detetion API is used. A few changes are made to the python code so as to enable object detection if live input stream is given through the webcam.

Steps:
1. Install Tensorflow
2. Download the necessary object detection model
3. Make a few changes to the code to enable reading live input via webcam
